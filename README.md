## Prompts

We include example templates of the prompt struture used in each of the GPT4GEO experiments, following the same order as in the paper.

### Descriptive Experiments

#### Population, life expectancy and CO2 emissions

e.g., for Population:
```markdown
For each of the following countries, provide their population in <Year> as a
python list in the following format:
[Population of Country 1, # Country 1
Population of Country 2, # Country 2, ...]
[<Country 1>, <Country 2>, ...].
```

#### Area and height

e.g., for Area:
```markdown
For each of the following countries, provide the land area in sq. km as of
<Year>. Provide the areas as a python list in the following format:
[Area of Country 1, # Country 1
Area of Country 2, # Country 2, ...]
[<Country 1>, <Country 2>, ...]
```

#### Location

```markdown
In a code block, provide a python list of tuples for the latitude and
longitude coordinates for each of these settlements - e.g., [(Lat,Lon), #
Settlement 1 ...]. Maintain the same order.
[<Country 1>, <Country 2>, ...]
```

#### Distance

```markdown
What are the straight-line distances between the following pairs of cities?
Output a csv list of the distances only in km.
<City 1 (Country) > to <City 2 (Country)>
... [repeated for all 40 pairs]
```

#### Topography

```markdown
Provide a rough estimate of the elevation at the following coordinates to
the best of your knowledge. Answer directly with a comma-separated list of
elevations in meters only but without indicating the unit in the output.
```

#### Outlines

```markdown
Please provide the lat/lon coordinates for the outline of <X> as a Python
list of tuples, consisting of approximately 50 points arranged clockwise.
Due to output length limitations, only the coordinates should be returned.
```

#### Languages

```markdown
Name all countries that match <language criteria>. Provide the output as a
python list.
```

### Application-Centric Experiments

#### Route planning

```markdown
Give me a step-by-step travel route from <Start Location> to <End Location>
[(optional) using only <Mode of Transport> ].
```

#### Navigation

```markdown
You start your journey in <Location A>. You take a <vehicle> and go
<direction> for <duration>. Where are you now?
```

#### Networks

```markdown
Provide a list of the names of the stations in order on the Hong Kong MTR
<Line Name> Line.
Give the latitude and longitude coordinates for each of these as a python
list of tuples. Maintain the same order.
```

#### Itinerary planning

```markdown
I am currently in <Source Location>. I want to visit <Destinations>, and
I have a budget of <Budget>. Provide a day-by-day step-by-step detailed
itinerary plan for the whole trip with a breakdown of specific places to
visit, foods to try out, as well as the required time, and money I need.
Provide a breakdown of how to travel to the destinations and come back home.
```

#### Landmarks

```markdown
What famous landmark is at this location: <Lat/Lon Coordinates> ? Provide
the SVG code for a detailed outline of the landmark.
```

#### Multi-criteria place retrieval

```markdown
Name all places in the world where <X>. Provide a python list in the format
[0.00000N, 0.00000E].
```

#### Supply chains

e.g., for Semiconductors
```markdown
I want to construct a map of the semiconductor supply chain, end-to-end.
Please provide the lat/lon coordinates and names of the key elements in the
supply chain, including design, manufacturing, materials, equipment + tools,
etc. If you don‚Äôt know any coordinates exactly just estimate, every point
needs coordinates.
```

#### Natural world

e.g., bird migrations
```markdown
I want to plot the migratory routes of various bird species. Please provide
the latitude and longitude coordinates of the migratory route of the
<bird species>. Indicate the start and finish and provide coordinates for
intermediate steps if necessary. If multiple routes exist, provide separate
lists of coordinates. Output the coordinates as a python list of tuples.
```
